# Natural language processing
This is a repository with some getting started code for natural language processing tasks.

It is not noob friendly, but rather is a starting point for people that already know what this is about, but don't want to spend lots of time on looking for their own notes and code templates.

Used dataset (amazon-reviews) is not really a good fit for this project, as labeling of the review scores from 1-5 is rather subjective and hard to predict precisely.
Thus, metrics are not really that great, but it is a good starting point.

Contains simple custom-made algorithms for comparison and debugging (01, 02), then explores more advanced and production-ready attempts (03, 04, 06, 07).
In addition contains some code for analysing the results of the experiments (05.1), as well as attempts to efficiently reframe the task by label elimination (05.2, 05.3).

Covered libraries: Scikit-Learn, Imbalanced-Learn, Flair, NLTK (briefly), PyTorch (briefly).

Feel free to use the code at your own risk.
